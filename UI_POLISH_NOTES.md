## Conversation List Spacing Adjustment

### Problem
Conversation threads in the conversation list were positioned too far from the left edge compared to the native iOS Messages app, creating a less native feel.

### Solution
Reduced List row insets and spacing to match iMessage layout precisely.

### Changes Made

**File:** `ConversationListView.swift`

1. **Added `.listRowInsets()` modifier** (line 26)
   ```swift
   .listRowInsets(EdgeInsets(top: 0, leading: 8, bottom: 0, trailing: 8))
   ```
   - Reduced leading edge from default ~16pt to 8pt
   - This is the primary change that moves content left

2. **Reduced HStack spacing** (line 117)
   ```swift
   HStack(spacing: 12) {  // Was 14
   ```
   - Tighter spacing between unread indicator and profile circle

3. **Removed horizontal padding** (line 188)
   ```swift
   .padding(.horizontal, 0)  // Was 4
   ```
   - Eliminates extra padding on conversation rows

### Layout Breakdown

**Before:**
- Default list inset: ~16pt
- HStack spacing: 14pt
- Row horizontal padding: 4pt
- **Total left offset:** ~34pt from screen edge

**After:**
- List inset: 8pt
- HStack spacing: 12pt
- Row horizontal padding: 0pt
- **Total left offset:** ~20pt from screen edge

### Result
âœ… Conversations now align with iMessage spacing  
âœ… Content starts approximately 20pt from left edge (matches native Messages app)  
âœ… Profile circles and text align naturally with iOS design patterns  
âœ… More native, polished appearance

## Design Philosophy

Small spacing adjustments like this are critical for:
- **Native feel** - App feels like it belongs on iOS
- **User familiarity** - Matches patterns users know from built-in apps
- **Professional polish** - Attention to detail matters
- **Consistency** - iOS users expect certain spacing conventions

## Testing
- âœ… Verified on physical iPhone device
- âœ… Compared side-by-side with Messages app
- âœ… Spacing now matches iMessage layout
- âœ… No layout issues or edge cases
