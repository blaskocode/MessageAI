## What Just Happened (Most Recent Work)

### Session Accomplishment: Local Notifications ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Notifications were not appearing despite implementing `NotificationService` with FCM and local notification triggers in `ChatViewModel`.

**Root Cause:** The notification logic was placed in `ChatViewModel`, which only exists for currently open conversations. Messages sent to *other* conversations were never detected because no `ChatViewModel` existed for those conversations.

**Solution:** Moved notification detection to `ConversationListViewModel`, which has a **global listener** watching ALL conversations. This listener:
1. Watches every conversation the user is in
2. Detects when `lastMessage` changes
3. Compares to previous state to identify NEW messages
4. Checks if message is from another user
5. Checks if conversation is NOT currently active
6. Triggers local notification with proper formatting

**Result:** ‚úÖ **LOCAL NOTIFICATIONS NOW WORKING PERFECTLY!**

### Key Implementation Details
- `ConversationListViewModel` tracks `previousLastMessages: [String: String]`
- Detects new messages by comparing `lastMessage.id` to previous state
- Uses `isInitialLoad` flag to prevent notifications on first load
- Filters out self-sent messages
- Filters out messages from active conversation
- Fetches sender's display name for notification
- Formats differently for groups vs. direct chats:
  - Direct: "[Sender Name]: [Message]"
  - Group: "[Group Name] - [Sender]: [Message]"

### Final Debugging Session
1. Added extensive debug logging to trace message flow
2. Discovered `ChatViewModel` was only processing its own conversation
3. Realized need for global listener in `ConversationListViewModel`
4. Implemented new architecture
5. Tested and verified: ‚úÖ **WORKING!**
6. Cleaned up all debug logs for production

## Current Work Focus

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETE: All MVP Features**

No active development tasks. MVP is complete and working.

---

## Recent Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Local Notifications Instead of Remote Push
**Context:** Apple Developer account stuck in "Pending" status, blocking APNs key creation  
**Options:**
- A. Wait for account activation (unknown timeline)
- B. Implement local notifications as MVP solution

**Decision:** Option B ‚úÖ  
**Rationale:**
- Foreground notifications meet MVP requirements
- Works with free developer account
- UserNotifications framework is reliable
- Can add remote push post-MVP when account activates

**Result:** Successfully implemented and tested

### Decision 2: Global Listener Architecture
**Context:** Initial implementation in ChatViewModel missed messages from other conversations  
**Options:**
- A. Create listeners in each ChatViewModel (memory intensive)
- B. Single global listener in ConversationListViewModel

**Decision:** Option B ‚úÖ  
**Rationale:**
- More efficient (single Firestore listener)
- Catches all conversations automatically
- Simpler lifecycle management
- Already has access to all conversation data

**Result:** Clean, efficient, working perfectly

### Decision 3: Group UI - Custom Navigation Bar
**Context:** `.searchable` modifier was hiding toolbar buttons  
**Options:**
- A. Remove search functionality
- B. Move buttons inside scroll view
- C. Build custom navigation bar

**Decision:** Option C ‚úÖ  
**Rationale:**
- Maintains full functionality
- Better UX (always-visible buttons)
- Custom TextField provides better control
- Modern iOS design pattern

**Result:** Clean UI with all features working
