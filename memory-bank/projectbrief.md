## Key Innovations 🏆

### 1. Local Notifications Without APNs
- **Achievement:** Notifications working with free Apple Developer account
- **Approach:** UserNotifications framework triggered by Firestore listeners
- **Result:** Foreground notifications fully functional

### 2. Global Notification Listener Architecture
- **Innovation:** ConversationListViewModel watches ALL conversations
- **Efficiency:** Single listener instead of per-conversation listeners
- **Smart:** Detects new messages via lastMessage changes
- **Filtering:** No notifications for active conversation or self-messages

### 3. Custom Group Creation UI
- **Problem:** `.searchable` modifier hid navigation buttons
- **Solution:** Custom navigation bar + direct TextField
- **Result:** Clean, always-visible UI with multi-select

### 4. Real-Time Typing with Auto-Scroll
- **Implementation:** Firestore subcollection + listener
- **UX:** Typing indicator appears above input
- **Polish:** Auto-scrolls to keep indicator visible
