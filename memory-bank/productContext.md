# Product Context

## Why This Exists
MessageAI is being built to create a modern messaging platform that will eventually leverage AI to enhance communication. The MVP phase validates that we can build a reliable, real-time messaging foundation before adding intelligent features.

**Status:** ✅ **MVP COMPLETE** - Foundation proven, ready for AI features

## Current Development Stage
**MVP:** ✅ Complete (10/10 success criteria met)  
**Status:** Fully functional on physical devices and simulator  
**Testing:** Comprehensive multi-device validation complete  
**Next Options:**  
- Option A: Begin Phase 2 (AI features)
- Option B: Polish and deploy to TestFlight
- Option C: Add post-MVP enhancements (media, profile pictures, APNs)

## Problems It Solves ✅ ALL SOLVED

1. ✅ **Reliable Communication** - Messages never get lost, even under poor network conditions (TESTED)
2. ✅ **Real-Time Sync** - Instant message delivery achieved (< 1 second latency, VERIFIED)
3. ✅ **Offline Resilience** - Users can access history and queue messages when offline (WORKING)
4. ✅ **Foundation for AI** - Clean infrastructure established for future AI features (READY)
5. ✅ **Group Communication** - Multi-user conversations with proper attribution (TESTED)
6. ✅ **Awareness Features** - Typing indicators and presence tracking (IMPLEMENTED)

## How It Works

### Core User Flows ✅ ALL IMPLEMENTED & TESTED

#### 1. Authentication Flow ✅ COMPLETE
```
User opens app
  → Sees auth screen (login/signup toggle)
  → Enters email, password, display name (for signup)
  → Input validation: email format, password strength, name length
  → Firebase Auth creates account or signs in
  → Profile created automatically with:
     • Display name
     • Email
     • Initials extracted from name
     • Random color from 12-color palette
     • Default online status
     • Timestamp for created/updated
  → Session persists across app restarts
  → User sees conversation list
```

**Status:** ✅ Fully tested on multiple devices

#### 2. Starting a New Conversation ✅ COMPLETE
```
User taps "New Message" button
  → NewConversationView appears
  → User types in search field
  → Real-time client-side filtering by name or email
  → Results update instantly
  → User taps a contact
  → Conversation created in Firestore (if doesn't exist)
  → ChatView opens
  → User sends first message
  → Conversation appears in both users' conversation lists
```

**Status:** ✅ Fully functional with instant search

#### 3. Creating a Group Chat ✅ COMPLETE
```
User taps "New Group" button
  → NewGroupView appears with custom navigation
  → User enters group name (validated, required)
  → User searches for contacts with direct TextField
  → Multi-select contacts with checkboxes
  → Selected count shows (e.g., "3 selected")
  → Create button enabled when name + 2+ users
  → User taps Create
  → Group conversation created with type="group"
  → All members see group in conversation list
  → Messages sent to group visible to all members
```

**Status:** ✅ Tested with 3+ users successfully

#### 4. Sending a Message ✅ COMPLETE
```
User types message in TextField
  → Typing indicator broadcast to Firestore (every 2 seconds)
  → Other participants see "Typing..." indicator
  → User taps send button
  → Message appears instantly in UI (optimistic update)
    • Shows with temporary UUID
    • Status: "sending"
  → Message sent to Firestore in background
  → Firestore returns permanent message ID
  → Local message updated with real ID
  → Status updates: sending → sent
  → Recipient's device receives via real-time listener
  → Status updates: sent → delivered
  → Typing indicator cleared
```

**Status:** ✅ < 1 second delivery, extensively tested

#### 5. Receiving a Message ✅ COMPLETE
```
Firestore real-time listener triggers
  → New message data received
  → ConversationListViewModel detects change in lastMessage
  → Checks: is this a new message? from another user? not active conversation?
  → If yes: triggers local notification
    • Fetches sender's display name
    • Formats notification (group vs. direct)
    • Shows: "[Sender]: [Message text]" or "[Group] - [Sender]: [Message]"
    • Badge count increments
  → Message appears in chat UI (< 1 second)
  → Saved to Firestore cache (offline persistence)
  → If conversation is open: mark as read automatically
  → Sender sees "read" status update
```

**Status:** ✅ Notifications tested and working perfectly!

#### 6. Receiving a Notification ✅ COMPLETE
```
User receives message in non-active conversation
  → Local notification appears at top of screen
  → Shows sender name and message preview
  → Badge count on app icon increments
  → User taps notification
  → NavigationCenter posts event
  → ConversationListView receives event
  → navigationDestination triggers
  → ChatView opens for that conversation
  → Messages load
  → Marked as read
  → Badge count decreases
```

**Status:** ✅ Navigation working, tested extensively

#### 7. Conversation Management ✅ COMPLETE
```
User views ConversationListView
  → Real-time listener on conversations collection
  → Filtered by: current user in participantIds
  → Ordered by: lastUpdated desc
  → Each row shows:
    • Participant names (or group name)
    • Profile circles with initials + colors
    • Last message text preview
    • Timestamp (relative: "2m ago", "Yesterday")
    • Unread indicator (if applicable)
  → Updates in real-time as messages arrive
  → Tap row to open ChatView
  → Swipe actions (future: archive, delete, mute)
```

**Status:** ✅ Real-time updates working perfectly
