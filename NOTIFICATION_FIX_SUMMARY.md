# Notification Persistence & Auto-Clear Fix

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Working  
**Testing:** Verified on physical device

## Problem

Local notifications had two issues:
1. Notifications would not persist in notification center (couldn't see them when dragging down)
2. Notifications would linger after reading messages in the app (only cleared when tapped)

## Root Causes

1. **Random UUID identifiers** - Made it impossible to track and remove specific notifications
2. **Missing .list presentation option** - Notifications showed banners but didn't persist in notification center
3. **No auto-clear logic** - No code to remove notifications when messages were read in-app

## Complete Solution (3-Part Fix)

### 1. Use conversationId as Notification Identifier

**File:** `NotificationService.swift` (line 87)

**Before:**
```swift
let request = UNNotificationRequest(
    identifier: UUID().uuidString,  // Random, can't be tracked
    content: content,
    trigger: trigger
)
```

**After:**
```swift
let request = UNNotificationRequest(
    identifier: conversationId,  // Trackable, enables removal
    content: content,
    trigger: nil  // Immediate delivery with persistence
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Each conversation has exactly one notification (newer messages update it)
- Notifications can be removed by conversationId
- No duplicate notifications per conversation

### 2. Add .list Presentation Option

**File:** `NotificationService.swift` (line 141)

**Before:**
```swift
completionHandler([.banner, .sound, .badge])
// Missing .list = no notification center persistence!
```

**After:**
```swift
completionHandler([.banner, .list, .sound, .badge])
//                         ^^^^^ Critical addition
```

**What .list does:**
- `.banner` - Shows temporary banner at top (already working)
- `.list` - **Adds to notification center** (this was missing!)
- `.sound` - Plays notification sound
- `.badge` - Updates app icon badge

**Without .list:** Notification shows banner but doesn't appear when you drag down from top.

### 3. Auto-Clear Notifications on Read

**File:** `NotificationService.swift` (line 118) - New Method
```swift
/// Clears notifications for a specific conversation
func clearNotificationsForConversation(conversationId: String) {
    UNUserNotificationCenter.current().removeDeliveredNotifications(
        withIdentifiers: [conversationId]
    )
}
```

**File:** `ChatViewModel.swift` (line 291) - Call Site
```swift
func markMessagesAsRead() {
    guard let userId = currentUserId else { return }
    
    Task {
        do {
            try await firebaseService.markConversationAsRead(
                conversationId: conversationId,
                userId: userId
            )
            print("✅ Marked conversation \(conversationId) as read")
            
            // Clear any lingering notifications for this conversation
            NotificationService.shared.clearNotificationsForConversation(
                conversationId: conversationId
            )
        } catch {
            print("⚠️ Failed to mark as read: \(error)")
        }
    }
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: Tap Notification
1. User receives message → Notification appears (banner + notification center)
2. User taps notification → Opens conversation
3. Messages marked as read → Notification cleared
4. ✅ Clean state

### Scenario 2: Read Without Tapping Notification
1. User receives message → Notification appears (banner + notification center)
2. User dismisses banner or ignores it
3. User opens app → Navigates to conversation via conversation list
4. Messages marked as read → Notification automatically cleared
5. ✅ No lingering notification

### Scenario 3: Multiple Messages
1. User receives message 1 from John → Notification appears
2. User receives message 2 from John → Same notification updates (no duplicate)
3. User receives message 3 from John → Same notification updates again
4. User reads conversation → One notification cleared
5. ✅ Single notification per conversation

## Technical Details

### Notification Lifecycle

```
Message Arrives
    ↓
ConversationListViewModel detects new message
    ↓
Calls NotificationService.triggerLocalNotification(conversationId: "abc123")
    ↓
Creates UNNotificationRequest with identifier = "abc123"
    ↓
Notification added to system with [.banner, .list, .sound, .badge]
    ↓
User sees:
    - Banner popup (temporary)
    - Entry in notification center (persistent)
    ↓
User Action: Opens Chat (without tapping notification)
    ↓
ChatView.onAppear → viewModel.markMessagesAsRead()
    ↓
Firestore: Mark messages as read
    ↓
NotificationService.clearNotificationsForConversation(conversationId: "abc123")
    ↓
UNUserNotificationCenter.removeDeliveredNotifications(withIdentifiers: ["abc123"])
    ↓
✅ Notification removed from notification center
```

## Files Modified

| File | Changes | Lines Changed |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `NotificationService.swift` | Changed identifier, added .list, added clearNotificationsForConversation() | 87, 118-120, 141 |
| `ChatViewModel.swift` | Call clearNotificationsForConversation() | 291 |

## Testing Results

✅ **Notification appears** - Banner shows at top  
✅ **Notification persists** - Visible in notification center when dragging down  
✅ **Tap notification** - Opens conversation, notification clears  
✅ **Read without tapping** - Notification auto-clears when reading in app  
✅ **Multiple messages** - Single notification updates, no duplicates  
✅ **Badge count** - Updates correctly, clears when opening conversation list  

## Key Insights

1. **Use entity IDs as notification identifiers** - Enables tracking and removal
2. **Always include .list option** - Required for notification center persistence
3. **Clear notifications on read** - Better UX than leaving stale notifications
4. **One notification per conversation** - Cleaner than multiple stacked notifications

## Impact

This fix provides a complete, production-quality notification system:
- Users can see all pending notifications in notification center
- Notifications don't linger after being handled
- No duplicate notifications cluttering the notification center
- Professional iOS app notification behavior

**Status:** ✅ Production-ready notification management complete!
