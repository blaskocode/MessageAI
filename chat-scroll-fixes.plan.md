# Fix Chat Scroll Bugs

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Problems

1. **Visual scroll on load**: When opening a conversation, messages appear at the top and then visibly scroll down to the bottom, creating a jarring experience.

2. **Keyboard covering messages**: When the keyboard appears (especially after receiving a message), it covers the most recent messages without auto-scrolling to keep them visible.

## Solutions Implemented

### Bug 1: Eliminate Visual Scroll on Load

✅ Used iOS 17+ `.defaultScrollAnchor(.bottom)` modifier to position the ScrollView at the bottom before it becomes visible.

**File:** `ChatView.swift` (line 40)

### Bug 2: Auto-Scroll When Keyboard Appears

✅ Used `@FocusState` with `.focused()` and `.onChange()` to detect keyboard and auto-scroll.

**File:** `ChatView.swift` (lines 14, 66-75, 88)

## Implementation Details

**File:** `ChatView.swift`

1. ✅ Added `@FocusState private var isTextFieldFocused: Bool` (line 14)
2. ✅ Added `.defaultScrollAnchor(.bottom)` to ScrollView (line 40)
3. ✅ Removed manual scroll from `.onAppear` (kept only `markMessagesAsRead()`)
4. ✅ Added `.focused($isTextFieldFocused)` to TextField (line 88)
5. ✅ Added `.onChange(of: isTextFieldFocused)` to ScrollView (lines 66-75)

## Results

✅ **No visual scroll** - Chat opens instantly at the bottom
✅ **Keyboard doesn't cover messages** - Auto-scrolls when keyboard appears  
✅ **Works for all scenarios** - Receiving/sending, 1-on-1/group chats
✅ **Smooth, professional UX** - Matches native iOS app behavior
