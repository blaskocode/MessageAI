# MessageAI MVP - Task List

**Project Status:** Code Structure Complete (20%)  
**Timeline:** 24 Hours to MVP  
**Platform:** iOS (Swift + SwiftUI)  
**Backend:** Firebase  
**Current Phase:** Xcode Project Creation

---

## üìã Cursor Rules Workflow

This project follows structured task management using installed Cursor rules:

### Active Rules
- ‚úÖ **create-feature-prd**: Generate detailed PRDs for new features
- ‚úÖ **generate-tasks**: Create task lists from PRDs
- ‚úÖ **process-task-list**: Task completion protocol (one sub-task at a time)
- ‚úÖ **semgrep-security-scan**: Mandatory security scanning of all code
- ‚úÖ **swiftui-development**: Modern SwiftUI development practices
- ‚úÖ **firebase**: Firebase integration best practices

### Task Completion Protocol

**IMPORTANT:** Follow these rules when working through tasks:

1. **One sub-task at a time** - Do NOT start the next sub-task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
2. **Mark completed immediately** - When you finish a sub-task, change `[ ]` to `[x]`
3. **Complete parent tasks** - When ALL subtasks are `[x]`, mark the parent task `[x]`
4. **Security scanning** - Run Semgrep security scan after generating/modifying code
5. **Wait for approval** - Stop after each sub-task and wait for user's go-ahead

```bash
# Use Semgrep MCP tool
mcp_semgrep_security_check({
  code_files: [
    { filename: 'path/to/file.swift', content: '...' }
  ]
})
```

### When to Scan
- ‚úÖ After creating new Swift files
- ‚úÖ After modifying existing Swift files

- ‚úÖ Final comprehensive scan before submission

### Handling Findings
1. **Report** what was found
2. **Explain** security implications
3. **Propose** fixes
4. **Implement** fixes
5. **Re-scan** to verify

## üéØ SwiftUI Best Practices (from Rule)

### Code Structure
- Keep views small and focused
- Extract reusable components
- Use ViewBuilder for complex layouts
- Follow MVVM pattern strictly

### State Management
- Use @State for local view state
- Use @StateObject for view model instances
- Use @Published in ViewModels
- Use @Environment for shared services

### Performance

- **Documentation:** 90% (comprehensive docs written)
- **Deployment:** 0% (pending Firebase setup)

### Remember
1. **One sub-task at a time** - Wait for user approval
2. **Mark completed** - Update checkboxes immediately
3. **Security scan** - Run after code generation/modification
4. **SwiftUI best practices** - Follow modern patterns
5. **Firebase best practices** - Security and performance first
